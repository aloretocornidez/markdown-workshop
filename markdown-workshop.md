# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.[^markdown-definition]

## Markdown Specification
There isn't one single kind of markdown standard.
Many platforms use their own of markdown specification.


## Why Use Markdown?
Markdown is a way to create readable text files that can be parsed by platforms to make multiple features easy to implement, e.g. headings, lists, links, code, math equations, images, etc.


## Platforms that Support Markdown

# Markdown Features
Let's discuss a few of the features that are possible with markdown.

## Text Styling
You can do simple styling quite easily:

*Italics*, **Bold**, ***Italic AND Bold***, __Underline__, ~~Strikethough~~,  <sub>sub</sub>script, <sup>super</sup>script

```md 
*Italics*, **Bold**, ***Italic AND Bold***, __Underline__, ~~Strikethough~~,  <sub>sub</sub>script, <sup>super</sup>script
```


## Headings and Sub-Headings
I've been using headings for this entire workshop, it lets you divide topics and subtopics.

### Animals
There are many animals species.
#### Dogs 
Dogs are pretty cool. I like dogs.
#### Cats
I also like cats quite a bit!
##### Orange Cats
Orange cats have interesting features and should be considered a species of their own.

## Quoting Text
> What you guys are referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

> Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

> There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.
